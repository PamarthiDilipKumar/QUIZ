Objective: Create an interactive quiz page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I've created a front-end quiz page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code includes essential elements such as a submit button, next button, timer, score, and restart buttons. 

The CSS code provides the necessary styles to make the quiz page interactive and visually appealing. 

In the JavaScript code, I've included the quiz questions and answers, as well as functions for displaying questions (displayQuestion), checking answers (checkAnswer), moving to the next question (nextQuestion), calculating the final score (finalScore), managing the timer (Timer), and restarting the quiz (restartQuiz).

When you run the code in a browser, the quiz starts with 5 questions, each having 4 options. You have 30 seconds to select an option. If your choice is correct, your score increases; otherwise, it remains the same. After answering all 5 questions, you receive your final score out of 5. If you wish to attempt the quiz again, simply click on the restart button.
